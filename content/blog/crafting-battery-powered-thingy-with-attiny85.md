You may be reading this post because of two reasons:
 - A - you're looking for resources about reducing ATTiny85 power consumption + deep sleep
 - B - you are really bored and are stalking my personal life
 - <sub><sup> C you're my english teacher considering whether to rise my grade or never read this again</sup></sub>

With both `A` and `B` you should be satisfied - but `A` *may* leave you with unanswered questions, because I'll be talking mainly about my specific use-case (described below).

"Option-A-choosers" should also know that this isn't a typical "scroll down to copy-paste the answer". You should probably read the whole thing :wink:

## What I'll be crafting
Main idea is - a pretty, flashy heart that's ment as a gift :)

Besides being pretty and flashy, it would be awesome if it would also turn out :sparkles:useful:sparkles:

// TODO: Photo of final result

### What it will do
I want it to work like a standard light/torch - you have a single button that you click to enable it, then it changes modes, then it turns off. From user perspective, this is blatantly simple. But form electrical/programming side, it may be a challenge.

The modes/functions:
- some pretty animations like rainbow etc
- torch - 100% brightness with white color
- night light - dim and red-ish light - for walking around a house at night
- backlight - for a bike or night walk - red bright light blinking like a heartbeat
- showing battery level

## Parts
 - For base, I'll use this cheap, brown-ish, single-sided, 5x7cm prototype PCB

   Double-sided green ones may be stronger, but would be a pain to solder since everything would touch the other side...

 - Battery will be taken care of by, beloved, TP4056 :heart:

   One thing I did, is replacing it's `R3` resistor with 10kOhm - this will limit the charging current to 130mA. This will be healthier for our battery. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6asCEBm4ZAw

   Oh, and I'll also de-solder the USB port, since Digispark already has it

 - LEDs of choice are, of course, WS2812. I'll use the strip instead of bear-bones SMD's - it will save some mess with soldering
 - :drum::drum::drum: and at the heart of everything, will be _**the**_ ATTiny85 - precisely, a Digispark board:

After laying everything out, this is how it initially looks:

## Making it low-power
...this is the part for all "option-A-choosers"

> Preamble: I am not a professional electronics engineer, and I didn't precisely measure every single step. I messed with this for 3 full days straight, and I'm gonna just tell you what I did :relieved:

Lifecycle we want to achieve:
- *The thingy* will be woken up by a button press, and will turn on the LEDs. In that mode, we don't care about the usage *that much*, but would be nice to bring it down too - that way, we could maybe have the "red backlight" mode running for long time :heart:

- ...after light is turned off, ATtiny goes to deep sleep. This is what we care about **the most**, since user could leave the thingy in that state for *a while* - maybe even a year. And we don't want to waste all the power *while turned off* - do we?

### Cutting away unnecessary parts
First off - [grab yourself a digispark schematic](/blog/crafting-battery-powered-thingy-with-attiny85/digispark-schematic.pdf)

Things from Digispark board that we can throw straight away - they waste power all the time:
- green power LED - this (as well as the red one) take hell lot of power - like 5mA~something => PWR on schematic
- big ass voltage regulator - I don't even know why they put it here - 99% of people will never use it - anyway, it also takes like 10~ish mA => MC78... on schematic

  In its place, I've also put small orange capacitor so the chip has nice smooth power :relieved:

There also is a 1KOhm pull-up resistor (R3 on schema) that keeps wasting power... but it's kinda required for USB communication... Solution? Solder it directly to USB-5V instead of VCC - this way it will only work with USB connected. Guy in this tutorial showed it nicely: https://www.instructables.com/Reducing-Battery-Power-Consumption-for-Digispark-A/ - but he suggests messing with a knife to cut the SMD resistor off (??) - I went ahead, de-soldered it altogether and used my own big ass THT one :relieved:

Ps. If you're evaluating if zener diodes for USB draw power or smth - don't. I tried de-soldering them, and it didn't make a ÂµA difference :ok_hand:

#### Other hardware surprises
This may not apply to you, but it turned out that WS2812's also drain power *while off* :flushed:

Quite a lot of it, actually...

<img src="/blog/crafting-battery-powered-thingy-with-attiny85/ws2812-draining-while-off.webp" width="400px">

This :point_up: is 19-LEDs strip, draining 5.7mA (that's 0.3mA per LED) *while off*! My heart has 10 of those, so - consuming 0.3*10=3mA - with a 150mAh battery - it would go from 100% to 0 in 150/3/24 ~= 2 days - **while off**

That's why I had to add small mosfet transistor to cut the power from LEDs:

### Playing with bootloader
While playing with deep sleep (more on that later), I discovered that ~50% wakes from it end up with reboot rather than back to my code - meaning, ATtiny does it's "6-second initial delay" thing

We do not want that - we want user to press the button and have the light instantly - besides, it wastes power too :roll_eyes:

So - turns out that Digisparks are running this neat thing called [micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) - it's a bootloader with soft-USB out-of-the-box! [Digistump Wiki](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tricks) says that if you want to remove "the 6-second delay", you should install alternative flavor of that bootloader, where it waits only if P0 is pulled down on boot.

Sounds great! Thing is, the links are old, and nowadays-version of micronucleus does not include that flavor compiled in "releases" folder. Luckily, I've successfully managed to compile it myself!

Here is my fork: https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/micronucleus/tree/87346a2d/firmware/upgrades - I added "`
upgrade-t85_jumper.hex`" and "`upgrade-t85_jumper_bod_disabled.hex`" versions - `bod_disabled` version should use even less power :)

> Note: If you're curious, BOD is some 'thing' that watches for voltage drops - you probably don't need this

Once you download `.hex` file of your choice, download the `micronucleus-cli` tool itself from their releases: https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus/releases

Then, open the terminal, and just run it: `./micronucleus upgrade-t85_jumper_bod_disabled.hex` - similarly to uploading your Arduino code, you first run it, and then plug the USB in :eyes:

...in my case, it didn't really work at first try :face_with_monocle: - try a mix of uploading bootloader, then the code, then bootloader again until it works :heart:

> Note: this seems scary, and sounds like something you could brick your device with! Well... probably yes, but I've done it few times with few boards, and didn't brick anything <sup>yet</sup>!!
> 
> > But, as a precaution, you probably should try with some backup board first :wink:

Tada :tada: boots _**instantly :100:**_
