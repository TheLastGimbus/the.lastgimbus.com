Okay, so I want to make my own app for my headphones... umm... how?

Luckily, [I watch Phineas and Ferb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gjt4L7GmG0), so I know what to do üòé we're going to reverse-engineer those bastards!

## But *what* are we looking for?

Soo... hmmm... - we are looking for some *data* - data about headphones charge levels, ANC modes, and other stuff...

So we need to find some way to watch **_the data_** sent between headphones and app, and spot stuff that we are looking for

For example, if we find some stream of bytes, we will take a look at charge levels from the app (for example, left bud 60%, right bud 85%, and case 100%), and look for those numbers (possible placed one after the other), like: `[60, 85, 100]`

At this point we're not sure if it will be that easy (for example, Huawei didn't decide to represent them as 0 to 255, or in volts) - but there's a good chance it will üëç

## Where to look?

Bluetooth has two main types: Classic, and Low Energy (BLE)

 - BLE is more than just new hardware that uses less power - it's a whole way of organizing data into services, characteristics... - I will not cover this here, since there are many great articles, and FreeBuds don't use BLE to communicate

 - Classic is fairly simple - it also has some way of organizing stuff to services, but that's it. Once something is a service, it has its own ways to communicate.

We're gonna look at both. BLE will be easier, because we can easily view it with some app, like [nRF Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp)

TODO: Screenshot that nRF shows nothing
