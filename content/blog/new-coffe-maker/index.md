Hi everyone!
I brought a new gadget last weekend. 

It's a coffee maker ðŸŽ‰

Reading my blog, you would expect some super smart, wifi-enabled machine - but actually, it's just a simple "transfer coffee maker".

I wanted to keep it cheap, because I want to use it in my dormitory. We can't have any high-power devices, so getting it confiscated is a risk.

I have had it for over a week, and I use it every day! However, I already noticed few issues:
- if you want just a cup of coffee, and will pour two spoons of it, the result will be very dilute ðŸ˜•
   - ...so, you neee to use way more coffee than you need - and it will sit there wet - and eventually, get rotten ðŸ¤®
- it makes a lot od noise - as any other machine, but still an issue ðŸ˜–

After all, I think it was made for offices and other places with crowds of coffe-addicts - not ordinary people. That said, I find enjoyment while using it, and do not regret ðŸ¥°

Now, I'm thinking of buying a coffe grinder, so I can get the best of coffe world â˜•

Anyway, that's all for now!

### Okay, what the hell did I just read?
So, we had a task on our English class to write a blog about recent gadget we bought - list it's qualities, etc. So I actually did it ðŸ˜Ž
