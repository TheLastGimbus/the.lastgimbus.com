Hi there 👋 !

If you're as a big brain as me 🧠 and, for example, you fried your only PC with your ESPHome's `secrets.yaml` file...

...and now you can't update, nor make new devices because you don't have your api password or encryption key...

...do not worry! You can restore them from Home Assistant itself! Here is how:

--- 

They are all stored in `config/.storage/core.config_entries` file 🌈

Open it in some text editor and search for `"password"` or `"noise_psk"` - here they are! Not hashed, not salted, just plain-text 😀

<sub>(for me, it looked like this:)</sub>
```bash
matiii@gimbpc:~$ ssh matiii@matih.duckdns.org
matiii@rpic:~$ cd docker/hass/config/
matiii@rpic:~/docker/hass/config$ grep "noise_psk" .storage/core.config_entries 
                    "noise_psk": "my_encryption_keys_E9KbabCF6occ6kodczlZssGQ="
                    "noise_psk": "my_encryption_keys_E9KbabCF6occ6kodczlZssGQ="
                    "noise_psk": "my_encryption_keys_E9KbabCF6occ6kodczlZssGQ="
                    ...
matiii@rpic:~/docker/hass/config$ grep "password" .storage/core.config_entries 
                    "password": "my_api_password_",
                    "password": "my_api_password_",
                    "password": "my_api_password_",
                    ...
matiii@rpic:~/docker/hass/config$ 
```
