## The story 🛣️
I wanted to quickly switch ANC modes on my headphones. So, I downloaded an official companion app from the vendor - it weights 300mb, takes up to **10 seconds** to launch, then takes it's own internal updates to run, and then, it kindly, allows me to do it

Also, it turned out that "find lost bud by last-seen GPS position" feature was only available to pro model - even tho mine could do this as well, but they just decided to disable this for cheaper ones

"This is bullshit", I thought. So I pulled out Wireshark🦈, figured out what commands are sent for different ANC modes, and made my own app. And here we are 🎉🎉🎉

## FreeBuddy is freedom from bullshit 🚫💩
