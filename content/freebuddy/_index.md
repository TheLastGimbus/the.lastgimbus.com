FreeBuddy is ment to be super handy app for your bluetooth headphones :sparkles:, with smart features

I have a dream of FreeBuddy supporting absolutely everything, but currently you can use it with Huawei Freebuds 4i (which it got it's name from)

App is still mid-beta, but already pretty useful! You can download it form Gitub releases: https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/FreeBuddy/releases or on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastgimbus.the.freebuddy
