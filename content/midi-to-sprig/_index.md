# MIDI-to-Sprig ðŸŽ¼->ðŸ“œ

Sprig is an awesome game console that you can get only by creating a game for it!

https://sprig.hackclub.com/

It comes with ultra-simple JavaScript game engine which allows you to start gaming very fast!

Below is a converter that takes a midi file - which you can create by, for example, making your own music with a piano keyboard ðŸŽ¹...

...and spits out code understood by the Sprig engine, so you can play your own cool music in your games!

Select a `.mid` file:

{{< sprig-tune-generator >}}

Then, use this in your code as such:

```javascript
// PASTED FROM GEN
// a list of all tracks found in the midi file
let tracks = [ ...
...];

tracks.forEach((e) => playTune(e));
// done! playing your music now!
```

If you want to later stop the playback, do this:

```javascript
// two different songs from generator
let song1 = [ ... ];
let song2 = [ ... ];

// array holding playback objects
let playbacks = [];

function stop() {
    playbacks.forEach((e) => e.end());
}

function play(song) {
    stop(); // stop whats currently playing
    // put playback objects returned by playTune() into the array
    playbacks = song.map((e) => playTune(e));
}
```
