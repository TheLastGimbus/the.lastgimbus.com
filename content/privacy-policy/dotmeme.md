The dotmeme app does not collect any personal information about you. 

I, @TheLastGimbus (Mateusz Soszy≈Ñski) (author), do not store emails, identifiers, or anything like that, on any server, because I don't even have one.

The app also doesn't use Firebase Analytics, or any other service that would collect your data.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at: 4i05wllh@anonaddy.me 

You can also find my Google Play Developer Page here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5962493469276784942

Thanks for reading, and enjoy using the app :)
