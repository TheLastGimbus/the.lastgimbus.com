The FreeBuddy app does not collect any personal information about you. 

I, @TheLastGimbus (Mateusz Soszy≈Ñski) (author), do not store emails, identifiers, or anything like that, on any server, because I don't even have one.

The app also doesn't use Firebase Analytics, or any other service that would collect your data.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at: 4i05wllh@anonaddy.me

Thanks for reading, and enjoy using the app :)
