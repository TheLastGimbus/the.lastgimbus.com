It comes with ultra-simple JavaScript game engine which allows you to start gaming very fast!

Below is a converter that takes a midi file - which you can create by, for example, making your own music with a piano keyboard ðŸŽ¹...

...and spits out code understood by the Sprig engine, so you can play your own cool music in your games!

Select a `.mid` file:

{{< sprig-tune-generator >}}

Then, use this in your code as such:

```javascript
// PASTED FROM GEN
// a list of all tracks found in the midi file
let tracks = [ ...
...];

tracks.forEach((e) => playTune(e));
// done! playing your music now!
```
